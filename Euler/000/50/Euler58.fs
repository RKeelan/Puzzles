(*
Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length
7 is formed.

37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18  5  4  3 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20  7  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
43 44 45 46 47 48 49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is
more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a
ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9
will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for
which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

(*
Basically, I need to find the diagonals of square-spiral with length N, then find out how many
are prime
- Make a memoized isPrime
    - cacheing the result of isPrime didn't help very much
- Instead, I'll run run the calculations for spiral N based on spiral N-1, and only check if the
    four new numbers are prime
